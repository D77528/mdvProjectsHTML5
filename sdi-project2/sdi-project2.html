    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<p>For this weeks topic I picked why I am pursuing the Mobile Development degree.  Having a degree in development will help expand my current job responsibilities at Compix Media.  I went over what I do at Compix currently, and what I will be hopefully doing once graduating.  It is a simple topic, but one that fits nicely into the flowchart given.</p>
<p>The code itself is pretty straight forward.  I added most variables at the beginning, except for each functions local variable. </p>
