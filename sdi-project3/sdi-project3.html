<p>For the Week 3 Project I decided to step out of my work environment and code a quick story of my morning routine taking my "kids" to school.  I quoted kids because I only have one.  For this story I made a fictitious kid called Willow.  The story goes through all required Object methods, and are organized by the methods themselves.</p>
